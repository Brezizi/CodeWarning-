# USAGE

The images are in Graphics/Unown/unown.png and Graphics/Unown/unown_bg.png. They are a long strip of images. They are default 32x32. 

If you want to display some unown text, use the following script in your Event:

pb_unowntext("Unown Text")

It can handle 14 characters of text at a time. It defaults to using left aligned text. You can also use ~ as newline characters.

If you want to display a panel, use the following script in your Event:
pb_unownscene("Unown Text")

Note that this scene is only 12 characters wide and is center aligned so keep that in mind.

Remember that Unown only have characters A-Z and ! and ?. The other characters display as spaces.

You can also have a version with specified alignment. Here are the alignment values:
pb_unowntext("Unown Text",0); // left align
pb_unowntext("Unown Text",1); // center align
pb_unowntext("Unown Text",2); // right align

Finally, you can have a background too. This will display the text like in Pokemon Crystal in the Ruins of Alph.
pb_unowntextbg("Unown Text") // left aligned background text
pb_unowntextbg("Unown Text",1) // center aligned background text

# MODIFYING

Essentially, this tool is a monospace bitmap sprite text generator, which could be useful for a lot of things.
You can make basic modifications to extend the usability of the script. I'm not the best Ruby programemr either, so feel free to improve upon my code and make suggestions.

The script assumes a sprite size of 32x32. You can change this size with the following constant:
SPRITESIZE=16

Similarly, you can modify the number of sprites on one line with this:
MAXLINELENGTH=24

If you add new sprites, make sure you update this variable. It's so that it displays blank spaces properly.
SPRITECOUNT=30

The code that determines which characters are printed is in the function setSprite(j) (line 148).
You can add custom characters this way.

The arrangement of the text actually occurs when the variable text is set. You should set your other variables before that. I said I wasn't a good programmer!
