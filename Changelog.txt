BUG FIXES:

- Some old sprites are still used as dialogue portraits.
- The Knight’s apprentice set of abilities is slightly different from the apprentice set you can access from the expert rank.
- Items are duplicated once during Battle Week, presumably on the first day.
- There is a "Now isn't the time to turn back" message that stops you every time you try to go to Team Magma's base. The message appears either after conquering the base on an old save or after wiping in the process of doing so.

- The Biker flag in detention is buggy as the fight can be redone infinitely as long as he does not drop out. 
- The detention you get for fighting him indoors is given for the same day, meaning the game considers you skipped detention the day after.
- The Triple Triad in the Student Lounge considers you do not have enough energy to play even when you have the exact cost requirement.
- Successfully flirting on the Pokegear will only grant you 1 Charm instead of 3.
- Chloroblast increases stats (?) and fails to cost half of the user's HP upon use.
- The scientist’s quest in Green Hills gives you 1 Charm instead of 3.
- The beauty’s quest in Riverside Road gives you Charm instead of taking it away for being rude.
- The Marowak and Mandibuzz quest says you gain 1 Charm upon successfully defeating one side, but you actually get 5.
- Any student above D-rank’s phone numbers will give you Akiza or Yariette’s options as the phone system is still incomplete.
- Cassandra’s phone options can lead to battles. 
- The Cafeteria event from class sometimes gives double the interaction points.
- A bug catcher in Lush Forest can be fought infinitely.
- You can dream a second time at the beginning of the game after checking your computer. It only happens from some angles.
- Mining in Mt Grassland (and possibly other places) only costs 1 Strength point instead of 2.
- On the ice field, the peak of the mound where Regice stands has no collision, allowing players to climb the last bit without using the stairs. 
- TM86 Phantom Force is located in all of Rain Forest, Aqua Cave and Haunted Manor. TM18 Reflect is located in both Rain Forest and Mind Asylum. TM13 Fire Spin is located in both the Game Corner and Magma Hideout.

- There is no Torchic Doll in S-Class dorms.

- Beedrillite is available in two different locations.
- The Ice Stone does not evolve Crabrawler.
- Item requirements for role quests and the last artifact cost one more than intended. Example: 2 Odd Keystones instead of one.
- Wave Crash’s base power and effect are incorrect.
- Dig makes your game crash if you use to escape from a floor field while having that Pokemon in front of your party.
- Losing to Blake during his quest softlocks you as a line of dialogue ("after the unfortunate defeat, you scurry back home") repeats forever.
- The Torchic doll does not let you separate from partners because a message stating you cannot have Pokemon followers while partnered takes precedence over the separation option.
- Teaming up with Tony makes the exit of the second floor of the library disappear. This can lead to a softlocke if the player goes there without any Fast Travel use remaining. Separating from Tony anywhere beside the library's second floor enables the exit to work again, but it does not change anything if the separation takes place there.

- Not picking your starter and sitting on your desk leads to a softlocke as you lose the opportunity to pick anything.
- Teaming up with Hyun crashes your game.
- The HM shopkeeper in the Student Lounge makes you crash because of HM03 on some days.
- When picking Lygn as your mentor, upon going out, you can skip the Mandy vs Lygn cutscene by going either left or right since the event tile is directly in front of the exit.
