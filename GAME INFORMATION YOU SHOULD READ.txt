- Pokemon Pathways is a PC game. You can try emulating it on JoiPlay, but expect glitches. You are advised to play it on PC to get the true Pathways experience. Moreover, if you encounter a bug on
JoiPlay, you are to seek support on the JoiPlay server first and foremost.

- If you encounter a problem with the PARTNER SYSTEM, like for example having an invisible character team up with you after you blacked out in a double battle, you can go talk to the TORCHIC DOLL or simply enter and leave the Pok√© Center.

- You can speed up the game by pressing F7.

- Time-based evolutions depend solely on your computer's clock. The time of the day in-game is irrelevant.
